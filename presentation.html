				Facebook was launched in February 2004 under the name The Facebook.com; it was originally limited only to Harvard students until it expanded to other Ivy Leagues the following month. It reached one million users, and did not yet have features like photos, walls, timelines, news feed, pages or events. Many of these features were added on in 2006 when it became public.

				This includes the option to share links to articles, photos, and videos, which was created on October 27, 2006. Shortly after, on the 31st, a "Share" button was created. Over time, the “share” option/button went through various changes and locations from the inbox to newsfeed, from having all share activities visible to the public to none at all. In 2009 a share count accompanied the share button, next to the “like” count.

				Today, Facebook's share button is an important factor in circulating information for the public. Most news/media sites now have their own Facebook page or at least have "share" options on their online sites.

			Additionally, sharing various types of news articles, videos, thinkpieces, memes, and more contributes to what Nathan Jurgenson calls our "documentary vision" : "We actively document ourselves and our world around us as if we have a camera in our hand ... or we can passively allow ourselves to be documented, curating our behaviors along the way (e.g., reading a magazine article so that you can present yourself as the type of person who “likes” that sort of magazine) much like a celebrity facing a crowd of paparazzi photographers." <a href="https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/tag/google-earth/"> source </a>

				Of course, especially post-election, we are also familiar with the phenomena of "fake news" or "clickbait." This has included blatant spam links, quizzes claiming to be able to define your personality, buzzfeed or equivalent"listicles," etc that aim to distract, mislead, or misinform.

				The option for millions of Facebook users to share content from other sites is an important factor in what Danah Boyd calls an "attention economy." The online community has grown smarter and gained the agency to differentiate between spam vs genuine content, to the point of recreating clickbait in the form of memes or ironic headline.

				Because of this, media sites must continue to devise new ways to publish and circulate their content in order to fight for social media users' attention, which runs at a rapidly increasing pace as the way we consume images and information becomes quicker but also more shallow and impulsive.

				An excerpt from Hannah Barton's  <i> <a href="http://reallifemag.com/tactical-virality/"> Tactical Virality </a> </i>
				</p>
				<p class="tab2">
				"The media is "a fluid information economy in which circulating stories could convene like-minded audiences around intentions, not facts...the news stories we share online signal our identities and affinities, assert status or social capital, or ... mark out our very presence.
				Aware of such practices, news producers and fake-news makers with an eye on circulation targets will publish stories and articles that serve this need — offering materials that allow consumers to communicate with one another and can form part of an online assemblage-identity. 
				Fake news creators ... had successfully rerouted the attention economy, exploiting how these underlying personal identity needs had helped render the contract between creators, distributors, and recipients of information unstable."
